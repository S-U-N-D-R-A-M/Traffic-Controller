# Traffic-Controller
The Traffic Light Controller is a digital system using Verilog HDL to manage traffic at intersections. It employs an FSM for state transitions, coordinating vehicle and pedestrian lights based on inputs like a pedestrian wait signal. Designed for FPGA or ASIC platforms, it ensures safe, efficient traffic flow.
